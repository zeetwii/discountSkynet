# Discount Skynet

Discount Skynet is a project created for the March 29th 2025 hackathon at SCSP.  It's meant to demonstrate how lightweight generative AI models can act as real time transformers to convert what would normally be high bandwidth complex data streams into low bandwidth text messages that can be sent over multiple low bandwidth long range communication networks, such as LoRa.  I believe this is a novel way to solve one of the main issues with drone swarms, which is the need for multiple high bandwidth communication channels to send and receive data.  By moving at least some of the data processing onto the drone or other remote device, we can reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network, and therefore reduce the bandwidth requirements.
